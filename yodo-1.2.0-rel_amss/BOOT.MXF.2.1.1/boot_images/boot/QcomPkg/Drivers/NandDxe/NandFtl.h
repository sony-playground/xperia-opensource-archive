 * for e.g. use this handle with flash_ftl_get_info to get ftl info in format flash_ftl_info_t
 * similarly to read/write data this handle should be passed with correct offset and size.

 *   This is the name of the partition that client wants to use
 *
 * @param handle [OUT]
 *   This is the handle that will be passed to client for further usage
 *   client needs to pass adress of the pointer in which this handle is to be stored
 *   if the return status is FLASH_FTL_OK then "handle" will contain handle to the partition
 *   and as described above this handle is used for any read/write operation on partition part_name
