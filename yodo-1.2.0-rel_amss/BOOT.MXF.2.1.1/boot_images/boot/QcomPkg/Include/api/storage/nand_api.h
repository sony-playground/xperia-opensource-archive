/**  \mainpage Flash NAND Functional Overview
 *
 * The Flash NAND driver provides a high-level interface for clients, such
 * as bootloaders, file systems, and tools to interact with the flash NAND devices. It
 * handles the Flash NAND device specifics and abstracts with the client from the device-
 * specific algorithms, interfaces, and OS adaptations.
